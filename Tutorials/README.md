## How to set up a self-hosted "vagrant cloud" with versioned, self-packaged vagrant boxes
 
As I dived into vagrant for a whole new project setup in my company, I was really amazed about how easy it is to get this "up and running".
But then I wanted to adopt the versioned vm service to the private network, because the official vagrant cloud was not an option for the company.
That's the point where the official documentation and support resources will lead you confused. 

Read `vagrant/self-hosted-versioned-boxes.md` for a basic company solution.
