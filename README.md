## What is this?

This is a collection of some handy code packages and tutorials to make developer's life easier.

## PHPExport

PHPExport is a small collection of classes to export PHP extentions or classes into PHP code or even a PHAR. 
This was designed to make auto completion and namespaces accessible for extentions or classes were only provided as compiled extension but not as PHP code,
e.g. pecl_http Version 2.x.

Please read the README.md in the subfolder for more information and a "how to use".

## Tutorials

I often come across tool or configuration issues that can be solved by reading tons of documentation.
These tutorials shall summarize each to a single page. Please discuss this and feel free to suggest corrections and improvements!

For an overview of the tutorials please read the README.md in the subfolder.

Happy developing!
